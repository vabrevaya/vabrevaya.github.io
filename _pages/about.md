I am a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://ps.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/">Perceiving Systems</a> department in <a href="https://is.mpg.de/">Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems</a>, Germany.

Before that, I did my PhD at Inria Grenoble, <a href="https://team.inria.fr/morpheo/">Morpheo</a> team, supervised by Stefanie Wuhrer and Edmond Boyer. My doctoral work focused on 3D face modeling and reconstruction using deep learning
techniques. I received a MSc degree on Computer Science from the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina.

My research interests include 3D computer vision, shape modeling and virtual humans.
